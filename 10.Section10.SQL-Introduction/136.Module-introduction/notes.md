# Section 10: SQL Introduction

## **Lesson 136: Module Introduction**

- [Udemy - a brief introduction about the different kinds of database](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/11738940#overview)

---

### **Objective**

In this lesson, we’ll introduce SQL, explain its importance in web development, and outline what you’ll learn in this section.

---

### **What is SQL?**

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: A language used to interact with relational databases.
- **Purpose**: Allows you to store, retrieve, manipulate, and manage data in a structured way.

### **Why Learn SQL?**

1. **Core Technology**: Many modern web applications rely on relational databases.
2. **Data Management**: Ideal for applications with structured data relationships.
3. **Widely Used**: Popular databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite use SQL.

### **What You’ll Learn in This Section**

1. **Choosing a Database**:

   - Compare SQL and NoSQL databases.
   - Learn when to use each type.

2. **Setting Up MySQL**:

   - Install and configure MySQL for local development.
   - Connect Node.js applications to a MySQL database.

3. **Basic SQL Operations**:

   - Create tables and insert data.
   - Retrieve data using `SELECT` statements.

4. **Advanced SQL Operations**:
   - Use `WHERE` conditions to filter data.
   - Dynamically insert and fetch data in your Node.js app.

### **How This Section Fits Into Your Project**

In the previous sections, you used local files to store product and cart data. In this section, you’ll transition to using a relational database for persistent data storage, which:

- **Enhances Scalability**: Easily handle more data and complex relationships.
- **Improves Data Management**: Perform efficient queries for data retrieval and manipulation.

### **Takeaway**

SQL is a foundational skill for backend development. By the end of this section, you’ll be equipped to integrate SQL databases into your Node.js projects seamlessly.
