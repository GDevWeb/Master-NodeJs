### **Objective**

This module introduces **Sequelize**, an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database operations by allowing you to interact with your database using JavaScript objects rather than raw SQL queries.

---

### **What is Sequelize?**

- **Sequelize** is a Node.js library that works with SQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MariaDB.
- It maps JavaScript objects to database tables, allowing you to perform database operations without writing SQL directly.

---

### **Why Use Sequelize?**

1. **Ease of Use**:

   - Perform complex SQL operations with simple method calls.

2. **Abstraction**:

   - Focus on business logic rather than SQL syntax.

3. **Cross-Database Compatibility**:

   - Switch between database systems with minimal changes.

4. **Built-In Features**:

   - Validations, associations, transactions, and migrations.

5. **Support for Relationships**:
   - Manage one-to-many and many-to-many relationships effortlessly.

---

### **What You'll Learn in This Section**

1. **Setting Up Sequelize**:

   - Install and configure Sequelize in your project.
   - Connect Sequelize to a PostgreSQL database.

2. **Defining Models**:

   - Map JavaScript objects to database tables.
   - Sync models with the database.

3. **Performing CRUD Operations**:

   - Insert, retrieve, update, and delete data using Sequelize.

4. **Managing Relationships**:

   - Define and use relationships like one-to-many and many-to-many.

5. **Building Features**:
   - Implement advanced features like a cart and order management system.

### **How Sequelize Fits into the Shop Project**

In the previous sections, you used raw SQL queries to interact with the database. With Sequelize:

- Youâ€™ll simplify database operations.
- Add relationships between users, products, carts, and orders.
- Build a more scalable and maintainable backend.

---

### **Takeaway**

By the end of this module, youâ€™ll:

1. Master Sequelize basics and advanced features.
2. Build a robust and fully functional database-backed Node.js application.
